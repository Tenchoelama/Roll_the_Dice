Project: Roll the Dice

- In this project, you will create a simple dice game where the user can roll two dice and see the total sum of their values. 
- The user should be able to click a button to roll the dice, and the dice should display a random value between 1 and 6 each time they are rolled. 
  The sum of the two dice should be displayed below the dice.

Here are some steps to follow to implement this project:

Step 1: Set up the HTML structure

Create an HTML file with a basic structure that includes a header, a main section, and a footer. 
Inside the main section, create a container for the dice and a button to roll them. Add some basic styles using CSS to make the page look presentable.

Step 2: Create the dice

Using HTML and CSS, create two dice that are positioned side by side in the container. Each dice should have six sides,
each displaying a number from 1 to 6. You can use images or CSS to create the dice faces. Add a label or a legend to display the sum of the dice values.

Step 3: Add the JavaScript logic

Using JavaScript, add a click event listener to the button that rolls the dice. When the button is clicked, generate two random numbers between 1 and 6,
one for each dice. Update the dice faces to display the corresponding numbers. Calculate the sum of the dice values and display it in the label or legend.

Step 4: Test and refine

Test the game thoroughly by rolling the dice multiple times and verifying that the values and the sum are generated correctly. 
Refine the code and the styles as needed to improve the user experience.

Step 5: Optional enhancements

Once you have implemented the basic version of the game, you can add additional features to make it more interesting or challenging. 
For example, you could add a timer that limits the time for each roll, or you could add a betting system that 
lets the user wager on the outcome of each roll. You could also add animations or sound effects to make the game more engaging.
